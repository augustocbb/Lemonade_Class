# Project I - INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATICS - TBD (DCC 601)

**UFMG - 2024.2**

## SISU Data Analysis

**Submission Date:** 01/25/2024

The objective of this project is to apply the concepts of Data Science to analyze data from a sample of SISU 2021 candidates who took the ENEM exam in Brazil, using the **LEMONADE** platform. The data used for this analysis were obtained from the following URL:

[Access SISU Data](https://dadosabertos.mec.gov.br/sisu/item/206-2021-relatorio-sisu-chamada-regular-2-2021)

Students must submit a report by **01/25/2025**, presenting the results obtained along with a discussion of the analyses conducted. The report should be submitted on the Moodle platform in **PDF format only** (submissions in other formats WILL NOT be accepted). The report must include all generated graphs and analyses, screenshots of tables, and your workflow. If graphs and tables from LEMONADE are not included, a portion of the final grade will be deducted.

The data file to be used is: **SISU2021.csv**, available on the [LEMONADE Platform](https://lemonade.org.br).
